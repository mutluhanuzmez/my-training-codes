Our scores: A: 2 B: 5 C: 5 D: 1805 E: 2085 Total: 3902

We first did a greedy graph algorithm for finding an approximate independent set (picking minimum degree node).
Then we iteratively improved the solution with simulated annealing (basically random swapping and checking if the result becomes better).
It found the solution of 2084 in E in 10 minutes, while A through D were found in a minute. 
During a testrun of the code, we scored 2085 in E, but we didn't implement writing the best solutions to a file, so this solution is lost forever.

Edit: Found another 2085 solution and saved the solution this time.

For the swaps we actually did two different things:

Swap a random pizza ingredient from "present on pizza" to "not present on pizza" or vice versa.
Pick a random person that is currently not satisfied and swap all ingredients which prevent him from being satisfied.
We did a 50/50 split between these two kinds of swaps, which seemed to get the best result.
